# Merry Christmas
#### This is a code repository, I have created to code daily from 1st Nov - 25th Dec(Mostly around an hour a day). Hence the name Merry Christmas.

#### The codes would be on machine learning and deep learning. Ranging from traditional ML models to deep neural nets for computer vision and NLP problems.

I will pretty soon put up a roadmap to what all problems I will be covering. You can also find a day wise short description of all of them down below in the table. Some typical things you can expect from these daily codes are:
* EDA on different datasets.
* Preprocessing data for better performing models.
* Experiments with plotting libraries and different mathematical graphs.
* Simple statistics and probability experiments.
* Traditional ML models from famous libraries like Scikit, Xgboost.
* Experiments with Kaggle competitions.
* Functions like backprop written using Numpy.
* Deep neural nets trained on GCP/AWS.
* E2E machine learning pipeline using Kubeflow on GCP/AWS.
* and a lot more.

### Daily Description
(Sample table, will be updated soon)

| Day | Code |
| ------ | ------ |
